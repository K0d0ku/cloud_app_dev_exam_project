# cloud_app_dev_exam_project
this is a .net maui app for my application development exam project, 
unfortunately the project is only 70% done from what i wanted, 
and might not be maintained after the exam
the main strategy of the app is to eliminate pc hardware scalpers and thats why i use the B2B2C strategy to ensure that every party gets their share, or thats what i wanted
